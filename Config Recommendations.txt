Batch File (Important): 

I personally recommend using the most recent version of Chrome for your OS, which are the following as of July 8, 2025...

138.0.7204.98 for Windows
138.0.7204.94 for macOS 
138.0.7204.100 for Linux

However, if your goal is to blend in then I'd recommend visiting amiunique.org, 
Click: "See My Fingerprint" ->  Global Statistics (Choose the last 15-30 days) -> Web Browser -> Hamburger Menu (three lines) -> View Data Table. 
This will show you which (Chrome) Version the majority of site visitors were using during the given timeframe.  

GPU Vendor: I suggest using "Google Inc. (Google)". Make sure your GPU Vendor and and Renderer are typed correctly so they match other users. 

GPU Renderer: If your similarity ratio on amiunique is high, meaning you don't have a unique GPU Renderer, than you can consider leaving this field blank. 
 - If you want to copy another Renderer, visit chrome://gpu for exact Specs to copy.
 - My personal desktop has a weird spec (AMD GPU, Intel CPU, Dell Motherboard / Firmware). However, my laptop doesn't so I usually leak GPU Renderer Blank unless I'm running a VM.

STEALTHY VIRTUAL MACHINES: 

CPU Cores / Memory (GB): If you have a normal spec native OS, i.e, 8 Cores, 16GB of Ram -- then you're ok. 

But, if you're running a VM without the ability to allocate a minimum of 4 Cores and 8GB, definitely use these inputs. (I still highly recommend getting an SSD / Qubes so you have the ability to allocate
normal looking resources to your VM for Redteam sims. 


Max Touch Points: 
-Set as 0 or leave blank for most standard desktops.
-Set as 1 for touch screen laptops.
-Set as 5+ for mobile device spoofing.
